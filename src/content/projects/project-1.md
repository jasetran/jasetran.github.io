Children thrive when learning through conversation. In this research project, we integrated conversational agents (CAs) into educational TV shows to support children's STEM learning. Our intial work focused on Elinor Wonders Why, and we are now expanding this approach with Lyla in the Loop, exploring its impact in both lab and home settings. The Converse to Learn project is the main project I currently work on through my graduate studies.
