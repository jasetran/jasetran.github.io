The <b>Rapid Online Assessments of Reading (ROAR)</b> is a an open-access, online platform of foundational reading assessments that is being developed by Stanford University. As a research coordinator, I programmed gamified reading assessments, coordinated research-practice partnerships with school, and analyzed data to support the development of the platform. I also designed the logo, website, and many of the app assets!
