            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! I am a <b>  first year Ph.D. student in Education specializing in Teaching, Learning, and Education  
                Improvement (TLEI) at the University of California, Irvine (UCI).</b> My advisors are <b> Professor Mark Warschaeur </b> and 
                <b> Professor Kylie Peppler.</b> I am especially interested in digital learning, primarily in evaluating and developing educational technology that can 
                support students with diverse needs. Through this research, I intend to better understand the learning theories and design elements that make these tools effective, 
                and implement into practice through research-practice partnerships. Before my graduate studies, I received my <b>B.A. in 
                Psychology from San Jose State University.</b> I also worked on the <a href="https://roar.stanford.edu/"> Rapid Online Assessments of Reading</a> project at Stanford University 
                where I designed and developed gamified, online reading assessments. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My work in the <a href="https://www.digitallearninglab.org/">Digital Learning Lab</a> centers on <a href="https://www.conversetolearn.org/"> Converse to Learn</a>, an NSF-funded collaboration with PBS Kids. 
                Our research investigates how children learn STEM concepts through interactive videos, using <b> Conversational Agents (CAs) </b> to enable their favorite characters to respond in real-time. 
                Imagine Dora the Explorer, but with Dora actually answering you! Through this project, I aim to enhance this technology to make STEM learning more engaging and impactful for students from all backgrounds.

         <h2>Chat with me!</h2>
            <p>
                I have experienced first-hand how powerful <b>mentorship</b> is. As a first generation Vietnamese-American college student, I would not have been able 
                to pursue a Ph.D. program without financial supports and <b>amazing mentors who took a chance on me.</b> If you are someone who has been historically underrepresented
                in academia (e.g. low-income, first-generation, queer) or just someone who is anxious about academia then feel free to reach out to me (<b>jasetran@uci.edu</b>) 
                for advice or anything else. I am more than happy to chat because <b>research is for everyone!</b>
