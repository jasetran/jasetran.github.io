    <h2>Resources</h2>
        <p> A growing list of resources that have been especially helpful for me: </p>
        <div class="wrapper" style="align-items: center;"> 
            <div class="res-col-one">
                <h3>Programming</h3>
                <li style="text-align: left;"> <a href = "https://swirlstats.com/"> Swirl</a>: This is a great resource for learning R because it's 
                free and teaches you in R Studio! </li> 
                <li style="text-align: left;"> <a href = "https://www.codecademy.com/pages/codecademy-discount-codes"> Code Academy</a>: If you're completely 
                new to computer science then Code Academy offers helpful courses with foundational knowledge to get started. They offer financial aid and discounts for students or 
                individuals coming from low-income. I was able to get Code Academy for free! </li>
                <li style="text-align: left;"> <a href = "https://github.com/matloff/fasteR"> Fast Lane to Learning R!</a>: This online course by 
                Professor Norm Matloff allowed me to practice and applied what I learned. </li>
                </li>
            </div>
        <div class="res-col-two">
            <h3>Design</h3>
            <li style="text-align: left;"> <a href = "https://astro.build/"> Astro</a>: Not super friendly if you have little experience with HTML
            and CSS, but still an amazing option (and free!). This website was created using an Astro template. </a> </li>
            <li style="text-align: left;"> <a href = "https://www.canva.com/education/"> Canva</a>: Canva is my favorite and the most accessible option
             for quick and easy graphics. </li>
            <li style="text-align: left;"> <a href = "https://procreate.com/"> Procreate</a>: If you're not familiar
            with digital art then I recommend Procreate for free-hand drawing. Almost all my design work is done in Procreate and then transferred to other editors. </li>
            <li style="text-align: left;"> <a href = "https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/"> Affinity Designer</a>: A slightly more affordable option to 
            Adobe </li>
        </div>
        <div class="res-col-three">
            <h3>Research Opportunities</h3>
            <li style="text-align: left;"> <a href = "https://flisci.org/"> FLi Sci</a>: A cool program run
            by Gabriel Reyes (Gabe actually helped me get my start in academia!) that provides research opportunities to under-served 
            high school students. </li>
            <li style="text-align: left;"> <a href = "https://bridgetophd.facultydiversity.columbia.edu/"> Columbia Bridge to the Ph.D. </a>: There are
            many who can't afford to do a Master's to pursue research. I recommend looking into post-bac programs and fellowships that provide stipends.  </li>
            <li style="text-align: left;"> <a href = "https://www.asgraduate.pitt.edu/hot-metal-bridge-post-bac-program"> Hot Metal Bridge Post-Bac </a>: 
            Another great post-bac program that provides a stipend and housing for fresh graduates at the University of Pittsburgh. </li>
